          Independent Call Auditors (ICA) is a small business made up of technology professionals who bring automated audio analytics
          to serve our clients as they strive to ensure quality communications with their clients or patients. Too often, the quality 
          of a phone call is managed and measured by the company who is the very entity that actually made and recorded the phone call.
          With no disrespect intended, this is the epitome of the fox-guarding-the-henhouse. ICA brings an objective and conflict-free
          party to the table to ensure an unbiased analysis of recorded phone calls.
          <br /><br />
          Uniquely, our primary focus is in healthcare, where hospitals and health systems often rely on third-parties for some portion
          of their patient collections communications. If this describes your health system, ICA services can bring integrity to your 
          Quality Assurance processes for any and all third-party, phone call communications with your patients.
