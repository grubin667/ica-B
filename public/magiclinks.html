        Contrary to what the name implies, <b>Magic Links</b> are not, in fact, magical. They&apos;re just code. But
        they do make signing in fast, easy and secure (and maybe a bit delightful).
      </p>
      <p class="des">
        With a <b>Magic Link</b> workflow the site asks you only for your email address, not a password. Then the
        application prepares and sends you an email containing a link with an embedded token.
        The token tells us who you are and sends it directly to your inbox. Further, the link is valid only for a
        short time, and it cannot be used more than once.
        You open the email, click the link, and you&apos;re in!

        If you&apos;re a returning registered user, we already know you and we load your settings.
        If we&apos;ve never seen you before or if you signed out, we ask you to enter a token that we text to you. That
        token lets us link you with the organization you&apos;re meant to be part of, with your Role in that
        organization already set.
